The OSRD Program consists of several projects that are managed and delivered as a single package.Â 

The program's teams are organized according to the **SAFe Framework**(framework for organizing agility at scale)*.
The organization of the program is therefore based on a Program Increment (PI), an iteration composed of 4 sprints of two weeks, followed by a consolidation and planning sprint for the next PI.
The SAFe organization involves :
- Teams working in a synchronized and interdependent way
- A sustained rhythm of deliveries
- A number of roles and ceremonies
- A feedback and validation process

The steering committees, which guarantee the smooth running of the program, make it possible to
- Define the project and product roadmaps
- Gather needs
- Define priorities
- Adapt the work methodology
- Issue validation reports based on the test reports submitted at the end of each Program Increment

**As the Program is still in a growth phase, the implementation of this organization is necessarily gradual, to reach its target by the end of 2022.*
